# üìù Prepared Notebooks for the Project

If you're using the Docker package, the notebooks provided in the `notebooks` folder are ready to use without any modifications.

However, if you're running the code from source and haven't installed the database-comparator package, you‚Äôll need to manually adjust the import in the notebooks. Specifically, replace the first cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from Database_comparator import db_compare
```

with the following workaround:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

import sys, pathlib
# Start from the current working directory of the notebook/REPL
BASE = pathlib.Path().resolve()              # same as pathlib.Path.cwd()
PARENT = (BASE / "..").resolve()             # adjust if needed

sys.path.append(str(PARENT))
from Database_comparator import db_compare

# Now you can import db_compare
import Database_comparator.db_compare as db_compare
```

## üîß Important Note

This modification will work only if youac run the notebooks from the `notebooks` folder. If you run them from another location, you will need to adjust the path accordingly or install the package properly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendation

To avoid setup issues and ensure a smoother experience, we strongly recommend using the Docker image provided with this project. The docker image and notebooks are designed to work with Simple configuration files, making it easier to get started without additional setup. All advanced settings can be configured directly in the notebooks.
